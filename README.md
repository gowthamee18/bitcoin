Comparative Study of Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM and ARIMA

üìñ Overview

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using two machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The study evaluates the effectiveness of these models in handling time-series data and provides insights into their predictive performance.

üõ† Features
	‚Ä¢	Implementation of LSTM and ARIMA for Bitcoin price prediction.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis and visualization of Bitcoin price trends.
	‚Ä¢	Comparison of models using performance metrics like RMSE.
	‚Ä¢	Real-world dataset (2014‚Äì2022) from Yahoo Finance.
	‚Ä¢	Cleaned and pre-processed dataset for enhanced model performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python
	‚Ä¢	Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyLab
	‚Ä¢	Google Colab for development and execution
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Algorithms:
	‚Ä¢	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
	‚Ä¢	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

üìÇ Project Workflow
	1.	Data Collection: Dataset sourced from Kaggle and Yahoo Finance.
	2.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and feature engineering using Python.
	3.	Model Implementation:
	‚Ä¢	LSTM: Deep learning approach for sequence prediction.
	‚Ä¢	ARIMA: Statistical model for time-series forecasting.
	4.	Evaluation and Visualization: Performance comparison using metrics and plots.

üîç Results
	‚Ä¢	ARIMA demonstrated lower error rates in short-term predictions.
	‚Ä¢	LSTM showed potential for capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data.
	‚Ä¢	Graphical comparison of predicted vs. actual Bitcoin prices.

üèÅ Future Scope
	‚Ä¢	Enhance prediction accuracy by incorporating external factors (e.g., social media sentiment).
	‚Ä¢	Explore hybrid models combining statistical and machine-learning techniques.
	‚Ä¢	Extend the study to other cryptocurrencies and financial datasets.
